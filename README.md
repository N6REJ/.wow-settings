** How to clone all repos in the organization at once.

1. first download and install [Git-cli](https://cli.github.com/)
2. install _**"Git-cli"**_
3. reboot
4. open console where you want the repo's to be.  For me, it was **_"E:\Development\MY_PROJECTS\bearsampp-development"_**
5. type `gh extension install matt-bartel/gh-clone-org`
6. after that's installed type `gh clone-org -y Bearsampp`

Thats all there is too it.  [Full instructions here](https://github.com/matt-bartel/gh-clone-org)


Contains an action, list-repos.yml, that will automatically create a list of ALL repo's and put it into "current-repos.md".
It specifically removes the 'website', '.settings' & 'bearsampp.github.io' repo as those are static and will always be preset.
